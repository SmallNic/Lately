# ng-hide
Angular has a directive called ng-hide. This hides elements when an Angular expression evaluates to true.
We can use ng-hide to hide the linked version of the title if no link exits and correspondingly show the unlinked version

# Services
Angular services are substitutable objects that are wired together using dependency injection (DI). You can use services to organize and share code across your app.
Angular services are:
* Lazily instantiated – Angular only instantiates a service when an application component depends on it.
* Singletons – Each component dependent on a service gets a reference to the single instance generated by the service factory.
Angular offers several useful services (like $http), but for most applications you'll also want to create your own.
